# Gesture Recognition using Graph Neural Networks (GNN)

This repository implements Gesture Recognition using Graph Neural Networks (GNN), a state-of-the-art technique for analyzing and understanding human gestures in real-time. By leveraging GNNs, the model captures temporal and spatial relationships within gesture data, enabling accurate recognition and classification of hand movements.

## Key Features

- **Graph Neural Networks:** The core of this project is the utilization of GNNs, a cutting-edge deep learning approach that effectively models dependencies and interactions between different parts of a gesture sequence.

- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition:** The model is optimized for real-time performance, making it ideal for applications such as sign language translation, virtual reality interactions, and human-computer interaction.

- **Temporal and Spatial Modeling:** Treating gesture sequences as graphs, the GNN architecture captures both the temporal dynamics and spatial relationships between different keypoints of the hand, resulting in improved recognition accuracy.

- **Training and Evaluation:** The repository provides a comprehensive training pipeline, encompassing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the gesture recognition system.

- **Customization and Extension:** The codebase is designed to be modular and extensible, facilitating the integration of new datasets, modification of network architectures, and experimentation with different hyperparameters to adapt the system to specific requirements.
