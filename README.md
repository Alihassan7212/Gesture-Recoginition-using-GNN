# Gesture-Recoginition-using-GNN
This repository implements Gesture Recognition using Graph Neural Networks (GNN), a state-of-the-art technique for analyzing and understanding human gestures in real-time. By leveraging GNNs, the model captures temporal and spatial relationships within gesture data, enabling accurate recognition and classification of hand movements.
